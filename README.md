# How To install a theme:
<p>
1: Go to %appdata%/BetterDiscord/theme
<br>
2: Download the Zip of the theme

3: Unzip the .css Theme into that folder.
<br>
4: For saftey reasons, Fully restart discord by either doing a taskkill or right clicking on the taskbar icon and quiting the program.
<br>
5: Launch Discord and see if the theme is in the list.

The Dark Red and Pinkie themes are based off the Dark Matter theme found here: https://github.com/Jiiks/BetterDiscordApp/wiki/Themes
